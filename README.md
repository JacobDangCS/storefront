# Storefront Phase 1
A front-end application that involves using React & Redux for modularity and is meant to mimick a deployed product. The deployed app works as a virtual store, with categories of products, products themselves, a cart that contains picked items, etc.

## Project Outline
Phase 1 consists of basic React set up and implementation of Redux. There is standard front-end components that need to be implemented and stylized, such as the header and footer. The bulk of the significant components are named "Categories" & "Products", where the former is used to filter product types and the ladder contains these types/identifications.

## Features
- React
- Redux State Management
- Product: Displays a list of products within a chosen category
- Categories: Shows a list of categories
