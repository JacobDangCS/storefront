# Storefront Phase 1
A front-end application that involves using React & Redux for modularity and is meant to mimick a deployed product. The deployed app works as a virtual store, with categories of products, products themselves, a cart that contains picked items, etc.

## Project Outline
Phase 1 consists of basic React set up and implementation of Redux. There is standard front-end components that need to be implemented and stylized, such as the header and footer. The bulk of the significant components are named "Categories" & "Products", where the former is used to filter product types and the ladder contains these types/identifications.

## Features
- React
- Redux State Management
- Product: Displays a list of products within a chosen category
- Categories: Shows a list of categories

# Storefront Phase 2
A front-end application that involves using React & Redux for modularity and is meant to mimick a deployed product. The deployed app works as a virtual store, with categories of products, products themselves, a cart that contains picked items, etc.

## Project Outline
Phase 2 consists of combining reducers, an "Add to Cart" feature, and an operating home page. The "Add to Cart" component accounts for added products and tracks the description and the count of products. Refactoring is useful for modularization and future phases.

## Features
- React
- Redux
- Combined Reducers 
- Add to Cart
